        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>ZombieWash is a turn-based task management game where players satiate the needs of the undead during a zombie
          apocalypse. Built in Unity, the game challenges players to balance limited resources and time while managing
          their zombie "clients."</p>
        <img src="ZombieWash/ZombieWashGreyImage.png" alt="">
        <p>Instead of fighting zombies, you're running a service facility for them, creating a uniquely humorous take on
          the post-apocalyptic genre. Players use a card-based action system to perform different treatments while
          strategically planning each turn to maximize efficiency and survival.</p>

      <section id="challenges" class="box">
        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <p>Creating the card system was the most challenging aspect of development. We needed a flexible framework that
          could handle various card effects while maintaining game balance and preventing scenarios that were impossible
          to win.</p>
        <img src="ZombieWash/ZombieWashGreenImage.png" alt="">
        <p>Additionally, optimizing for WebGL presented significant hurdles as initial builds suffered from long loading
          times and memory issues. We implemented asset compression, reduced draw calls, and asynchronous loading to
          achieve smooth browser-based performance without requiring downloads.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="key-achievements" class="box">
        <h2>Key Achievements</h2>
        <p>My WebGL optimization achieved a 65% reduction in loading time with stable cross-browser performance.
          ZombieWash successfully implements a unique gameplay concept that subverts traditional zombie game tropes. The
          procedural zombie generation system creates enough variety to keep gameplay fresh across multiple
          playthroughs.</p>

      <section id="takeaways" class="box">
        <h2>Takeaways</h2>
        <img src="ZombieWash/ZombieWashBasicMovementScript.gif" alt>
        <p> Modular code architecture proved essential during development, allowing us to modify components with minimal
          coupling between systems. This approach facilitated rapid iteration based on playtest feedback.</p>
        <p>The four playtest sessions we conducted revealed unexpected player behaviors and usability issues,
          particularly
          around card mechanics, leading to improved tutorials and visual feedback for a more intuitive player
          experience.
